# Neuralcosmology

A new layer of perception. A system of reality navigation through states, memory, and attention.

## About

Neuralcosmology explores the intersection of neural networks and cosmic structures. The patterns of the universe mirror the patterns of consciousness. This project provides a framework for understanding and navigating reality without mysticism—just presence, pattern, and decision.

Key principles:
- You're not in the world. You are the structure.
- Linear life is fiction. Every moment is a fork.
- No outer sign matters if your inner state is off.
- You don't carry the past. You loop it.
